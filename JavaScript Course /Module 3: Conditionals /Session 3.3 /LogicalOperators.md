# Session 3.3 - Logical Operators

JavaScript logical operators enable the combination or negation of conditions to control program flow, make decisions, and provide alternative values. In a prior session, comparison operators assessed the relationship between two values, consistently resulting in a boolean (`true` or `false`). Their primary application is to link several conditions within `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements. :gear:

### Three Main Logical Operators:
Logical operators allow you to combine or modify Boolean expressions to dictate how a program executes.

`&&` (AND): Returns `true` if both operands are `true` [2].

`||` (OR): Returns `true` if at least one operand is `true` [2].

`!` (NOT): Reverses the boolean value of an operand (e.g., `!true` is `false`) [2].
