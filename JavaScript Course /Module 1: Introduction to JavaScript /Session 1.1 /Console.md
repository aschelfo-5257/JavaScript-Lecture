# Session 1.1 - Console

The console in JavaScript refers to the console object, which provides access to the browser's or Node.js environment's debugging console. It is a global object, meaning it can be accessed from anywhere within your JavaScript code.

**Purpose and Usage:** :computer:
- The primary purpose of the console object is to facilitate debugging and development by allowing developers to output information, track variables, and monitor code execution. It offers various methods for different types of output:
- In JavaScript, the console keyword refers to an object, a collection of data and actions, that we can use in our code. Keywords are words that are built into the JavaScript language, so the computer recognizes them and treats them specially.
- One action, or method, built into the console object is the <mark>.log()</mark> method. When we write <mark>console.log()</mark>, what we put inside the parentheses will get printed, or logged, to the console.

**console.log():** :key:
- The most commonly used method, it prints general messages, variable values, or objects to the console.

**Example:**
- You will display the values to the logged console like <mark>"Hello, JavaScript"</mark>

      console.log("Hello, JavaScript!");

### Summary:
The console serves as a powerful tool for developers to understand the flow of their JavaScript code, identify and resolve bugs, and gain insights into the application's runtime behavior.
