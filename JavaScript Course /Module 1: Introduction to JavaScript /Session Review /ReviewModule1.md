# Module 1 Review:

### **Consoles:**
- The `console.log()` function is a built-in tool in JavaScript often used to output messages, values, and expressions to a debugging console, which is part of a web browser's developer tools.
### **Comments:**
- Comments are most important in code and documentation. Single-line `//` is a double slash forward to write on this line, and multi-line `/*...*/` is to begin and end a statement.
### **DataTypes:**
- There are two main groups: `Number`, `BigInt`, `String`, `Boolean`, `Null`, `Undefined`, and `Symbol` are the immutable primitive seven data types, and one non-primitive `Object` for the eight fundamental data types.
### **Arithmetic Operators:**
- They used to perform mathematical calculations on numbers. Remember that the operators include `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, and `**` for performing operations with numerical operands.
### **String Concatenation:**
- This process is to ensure that the proper two or more strings are joined so the computer can operate the chain spaces. Remember `-` operator is defined for arithmetic operations.
### **Properties:**
- A property is a fundamental component of an object, representing an association between a key (name) and a value. `length` is a data structure that stores properties.
### **Methods:**
- It is essential in JavaScript for several key reasons, primarily to resolve the organization, reusability, and object-oriented programming principles. 
### **Built-in Objects:**
- They provide fundamental operations for working with data types. `Math` offers mathematical constants and functions for appropriate methods to ensure readability and maintainability.
