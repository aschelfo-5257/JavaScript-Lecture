# Session 1.3 - Data Types

Data types are the classifications we give to the different kinds of data that we use in programming. They are crucial because they define the kind of data a variable can hold, determining what operations are allowed and how much memory is needed. In JavaScript, there are eight fundamental data types: :gear:

**Number:**
- Any number, including numbers with decimals: <mark>4</mark>, <mark>8</mark>, <mark>24</mark>, <mark>1250</mark>, <mark>26.30</mark>

**BigInt:**
- Any number, greater than 2⁵³-1 or less than -(2⁵³-1), with n appended to the number: 1234567890123456n.

**String:**
- Any grouping of characters on the keyboard (letters, numbers, spaces, symbols, etc.)

Single quotes:

      '...'

Double quotes:

      "..."

- Although strings are fundamental for handling and manipulating text in JavaScript applications. Will learn more about them later in the process.

**Boolean:**
- This data type only has two possible values: either it's <mark>true</mark> or <mark>false</mark> (without the quotes). It is helpful to think of booleans as on and off switches or to answer the "yes" or "no" question.

**Null:**
- This data type represents the intentional absence of a value, and is represented by the keyword <mark>null</mark> (without quotes).

**Undefined:**
- This data type is denoted by the keyword <mark>undefined</mark> (without quotes). It also represents the absence of a value, though it has a different use than <mark>null</mark>. undefined means that a given value does not exist.

**Symbol:**
- A newer feature of the language, symbols are unique identifiers that are useful in more complex coding. No need to worry about these for now.

**Objects:**
- An object is a fundamental data structure to used to store collections of related data and functionally. Therefore, the non-primitive data type is more for complex rather than by value.

:bulb: Understanding and correctly using JavaScript's eight built-in data types is important for writing effective, predicture, and maintainable code. As Javascript dynamically typed language that is a flexible type, but being aware of undyling types is still vital for writing realiable code. JavaScript will sometimes automatically convert data types to complete a operation, which can lead to unexpected and buggy behavior.

### Summary:
JavaScript has a broadly eight built-in data types to catorgized into a primitive and non-primative types. Using appropriate data type makes code more self-documenting and easier developers to understand the fundmental.
