# Lesson 1.6 - Properties

When we introduce a new piece of data into JavaScript properties. The purpose is to inspect and display the values of those properties in the browser's developer console. It allows us to check the current state and value of variables, objects, and their properties at specific points in the code's execution. For instance, we call a `length` that stores the number of characters in a string. We can log the values of properties as long as they are producing the expected results.

    console.log('Hello!'.length); // Output: 6
    console.log('This is a length'.length); // Output: 16

The `.` is another operator! "Treat it as it is: a dot operator."

The console.log(); `.length` shows how many characters and includes the symbols, space, inside the parentheses.

:bulb: The value saved to the `length` property is retrieved from the instance of the string, `Hello!`. In above, The program prints `6` to the console because it has six characters in it! A Javascript object is a data structure that stores a collection of properties. Reminds to output messages or values to the console.

### Summary:

You can log an in-depth analysis of the whole user `length`Â object and all of its characteristics; the console often supports an expanded amount of characters.
