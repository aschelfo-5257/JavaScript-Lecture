# Lesson 1.2 - Comments

Comments are lines of code that the JavaScript engine intentionally ignores during execution. Code can quickly become difficult to understand when revisiting it later, so comments help us and others make sense of it.

**Two Main Components:**

- <mark>**Single-line comment:**</mark> will comment out a single line, and it is denoted with two forward slashes <mark>//</mark> preceding it.

      // This is a single-line comment in programming.

- <mark>**Multi-line comment:**</mark> will comment out multiple lines, and it is denoted with:
- <mark>/*</mark> to begin the comment
- <mark>*/</mark> to the end of the statement

      /*This is a multiple-line comment in programming.*/

**Why are comments important?**

- Comments clarify the purpose of the logic of the code to modify existing code more easily and identify notes. Comments facilitate teamwork by ensuring that all developers involved in a project understand each other's side.

### Summary:
Comments in code are not executed and serve as explanations. Collaboration can enhance clarity and help the community understand the comments better.
